## About The Project

There are many great ToDoList apps nowadays but it is greater with respect to the amount of modifiability it provides. I have created a basic yet powerful To-Do list app that is very powerful.

Here's why:

* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. you do not need to worry about changing your phone as your data will be safe.
* You can access your data on multiple devices.
* You have an authentication system so nobody can access your secrets. :smile:
